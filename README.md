# Deep learning analysis for detection of volcanic ash deposit
Code for the study project "Einsatz von Cloud Computing Services fuer Deep Learning in der Fernerkundung" in the winter semester 2020/2021 at the University of Muenster.\
### Cloud Computing Plattform
For performing this analysis an AWS EC2 *g4dn.xlarge* instance was used.\
### Deep learning analysis
The deep learning analysis is a binary classification that uses an U-Net.\
### Data base
As a data base Sentinel-2 satellite images (with five bands: B2, B3, B4, B8, B12) and corresponding masks were used, both as GeoTIFFs.
